Hello and Welcome! I am an Associate Professor at the School of Public Economics and Administration, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests include international and comparative political economy, public opinion, and policy issues in East Asia. I use quantitative methods to answer theoretically interesting questions. My work has been published in Comparative Political Studies, International Interactions, and International Political Science Review among others. I have also served as an editorial board member for International Interactions since 2021.
